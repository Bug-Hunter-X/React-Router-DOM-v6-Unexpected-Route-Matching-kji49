# React Router DOM v6 Unexpected Route Matching Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Router DOM v6 related to unexpected route matching or a lack of matching routes.  The issue often arises from incorrect path definitions, typos, or interactions with other parts of the application.

## The Bug

The provided `bug.js` file contains a seemingly straightforward React Router setup. However, depending on the URLs visited, it might exhibit unexpected behavior:

- **Incorrect route matching:** The app might render the wrong component for a given URL.
- **No matching route:** The app might display an error or nothing at all if no route matches the current URL.

The root cause of this error often lies in a misunderstanding or mistake within the routing configuration, potentially stemming from:

* **Typos in the `path` prop**: A slight typo in a route path can prevent it from matching the URL.
* **Incorrect path structure**: Missing wildcards (`*`), using `/` incorrectly, or neglecting to account for optional segments can cause mismatches.
* **Route order**: While generally not an issue, the order in which routes are declared can sometimes affect which routes match.
* **Conflicting routes**: Overlapping or ambiguous route definitions can lead to unpredictable behavior.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, highlighting how these issues can be addressed.
